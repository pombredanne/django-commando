django-commando
===============

django-commando builds on Django's management command API to simplify writing,
overriding and sequencing Django management commands in a declarative style.

### Motivation

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s management command API is the
everyday workhorse of the Django toolkit. However, the API is very basic
and doesn't provide convenient object-oriented hooks to modify the flow
of data and code through a command.

django-commando attempts to improve the management command API with the
following features:

*   a declarative API for managing and processing command options and
    option groups
*   a declarative API for specifying which action or actions to perform when
    the command is run
*   a uniform and relatively simple way to override existing management
    commands without writing nasty hacks
*   simple methods for checking the existence of and running other management
    commands and shell programs
*   optional overrides of Django's core and contrib management commands
*   optional overrides of management commands for the popular projects
    [South](http://south.aeracode.org/),
    [Haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/) and
    [django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/en/)

### Installation and Usage

django-commando is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), so you
should install it with pip:

```
pip install django-commando
```

To use the provided Django or third-party management command overrides,
add any of the `commando` apps to the <strong>end</strong> of your
`INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    # Example apps that have commando.contrib overrides available.
    "cms",
    "haystack",
    "south",
    # ...
    # The management command overrides.
    "commando.django.core",
    "commando.django.contrib.auth",
    "commando.django.contrib.gis",
    "commando.django.contrib.sessions",
    "commando.django.contrib.sitemaps",
    "commando.django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "commando.contrib.cms",
    "commando.contrib.haystack",
    "commando.contrib.south",
)
```

It's important that these management commands appear at the end of
`INSTALLED_APPS`. Django searches for management commands in the opposite
order of its tools like template loaders and static files finders. It will
search the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in reverse until it finds the
command. Here, `"commando.contrib.south"` appears below `"south"`, so 
when we run a `south` command, `commando`'s version in
`command.contrib.south` will be called.

Let's look at the `help` for `south`'s command `migrate`, which is handled
by `commando.contrib.south`:

```
$ python manage.py help migrate
Usage: manage.py migrate [appname] [migrationname|zero] [--all] [--list] [--skip] [--merge] [--no-initial-data] [--fake] [--db-dry-run] [--database=dbalias]

Runs migrations for all apps.

Options:
  -q, --quiet           Suppress all prompts and output.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  [migrate options]:
    These options will be passed to migrate.

    --all               Run the specified migration for all apps.
    --list              List migrations noting those that have been applied
    --changes           List changes for migrations
    --skip              Will skip over out-of-order missing migrations
    --merge             Will run out-of-order missing migrations as they are -
                        no rollbacks.
    --no-initial-data   Skips loading initial data if specified.
    --fake              Pretends to do the migrations, but doesn't actually
                        execute them.
    --db-dry-run        Doesn't execute the SQL generated by the db methods,
                        and doesn't store a record that the migration(s)
                        occurred. Useful to test migrations before applying
                        them.
    --delete-ghost-migrations
                        Tells South to delete any 'ghost' migrations (ones in
                        the database but not on disk).
    --ignore-ghost-migrations
                        Tells South to ignore any 'ghost' migrations (ones in
                        the database but not on disk) and continue to apply
                        new migrations.
    --noinput           Tells Django to NOT prompt the user for input of any
                        kind.
    --database=DATABASE
                        Nominates a database to synchronize. Defaults to the
                        "default" database.

  [standard options]:
    Standard Django management command options.

    -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
    --settings=SETTINGS
                        The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
    --pythonpath=PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
    --traceback         Print traceback on exception
```

You can see that django-commando groups the options, showing you `migrate`'s
specific options, separated from the standard options for every Django command.
The `--version` and `-h, --help` options are added by the underlying
`optparse` module, and the `-q, --quiet` options is displayed at the top for
user convenience.

If we remove `"commando.contrib.south"` from `INSTALLED_APPS`, then `south`
will handle the `migrate` command:

```
$ python manage.py help migrate
Usage: manage.py migrate [options] [appname] [migrationname|zero] [--all] [--list] [--skip] [--merge] [--no-initial-data] [--fake] [--db-dry-run] [--database=dbalias]

Runs migrations for all apps.

Options:
  -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings=SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath=PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Print traceback on exception
  --all                 Run the specified migration for all apps.
  --list                List migrations noting those that have been applied
  --changes             List changes for migrations
  --skip                Will skip over out-of-order missing migrations
  --merge               Will run out-of-order missing migrations as they are -
                        no rollbacks.
  --no-initial-data     Skips loading initial data if specified.
  --fake                Pretends to do the migrations, but doesn't actually
                        execute them.
  --db-dry-run          Doesn't execute the SQL generated by the db methods,
                        and doesn't store a record that the migration(s)
                        occurred. Useful to test migrations before applying
                        them.
  --delete-ghost-migrations
                        Tells South to delete any 'ghost' migrations (ones in
                        the database but not on disk).
  --ignore-ghost-migrations
                        Tells South to ignore any 'ghost' migrations (ones in
                        the database but not on disk) and continue to apply
                        new migrations.
  --noinput             Tells Django to NOT prompt the user for input of any
                        kind.
  --database=DATABASE   Nominates a database to synchronize. Defaults to the
                        "default" database.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

For complex commands, you may find the option groups helpful. Each command
overridden by `commando` groups the command's options for the `help` display
and calls the underlying management command when run. If you don't care about
the option grouping, simply don't add the `commando` apps to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

management commands. Read on to see how to use them.
